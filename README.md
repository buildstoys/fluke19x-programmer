Random notes:
- A fixed baud rate of 115200 was used, which should work everywhere. Other speeds were not tested.
- 12MHz crystal was used, which should result in about 7.5% baud rate error, wich was not a problem.
- Forgot to mark LEDs and polarized caps on silkscreen (used non-polarized ceramic caps in practice).
